# Image-Processing
In this project, I've built an n8n workflow to automatically transform a casual photo of any product - captured using a camera - into professional-looking, studio style image that can be used for marketing process.

This application would be considerably beneficial to small-scale artisan producers or local manufactures with little marketing budget. It offers an affordable option to elevate brand prescene online, enhance products listing, generates marketing material that looks professional and polished, without investing signficantly in marketing.
